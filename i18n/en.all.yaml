message_ratings:
  other: |-
    Here you can configure the default content rating. The filter will be disabled if you explicitly use `rating:[safe|questionable|explicit]` in the search, and when you enable/disable all options below.

    All content has one of three types of ratings: `{{.Safe}}`, _{{.Questionable}}_ and *{{.Explicit}}*.

    *{{.Explicit}}*
    Any content where the genitals are open and easily visible. This includes the demonstration of sex, masturbation or any other penetration.

    `{{.Safe}}`
    Content for a public viewing of which you would not feel guilty. Images of nudity, naked nipples or pubic hair, camel hair or any kind of sexually challenging posture are NOT `{{.Safe}}` and are _{{.Questionable}}_. Swimsuits and underwear are borderline cases.

    _{{.Questionable}}_
    Basically everything that is not in the category above. This is a large middle area, you should not expect anything in this or that way when viewing such content.

    Please note: sometimes *{{.Explicit}}* can be marked as `{{.Safe}}`, and vice versa.
message_resources:
  other: Here you can customize the sources of search results. Please note that the
    same result in two or more resources may have different ratings or contain a different
    set of tags.
